        <h4>Movies with the Human</h4>
          <article>
            <p>Just like this video, I was sitting comfortably on the couch with the
              human when all of a sudden he plunges into my stack of pillows and
              causes me to go flying into the window! My face print is still there and
              it's already been three hours since that emotionally scarring event!
              Don't worry, guys! I plan to shove my dirty kitty face in his most
              beloved food later! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA</p>

        <h4>Silly Human Thinks He Can Hide Food</h4>
          <article>
            <p>Alas, he has come home! I took one look at his loots and I could smell
              the tuna lying dormant among the disgusting plants and other inedibles
              shoves down his throat. Soon it will be mine! He shall rue the day
              he flung me from my throne!</p>

        <h4>I'll Get Him Back for Removing Me from the Trash!</h4>
          <article>
            <p>The sun arose, but the my food bowl is empty! Curse the lazy freaks!
              The tall one occasionally feeds me when he hears my beautiful music...
              I shall serenade him with the song of my people!</p>
