      <p class="thoughts">I met a few people recently who have sparked my interest
        in DevOps. Due to having no idea what it is, I ended up having around
        40 tabs open that, although I don't want to lose them, I don't want to
        have to open them all up just to remember what on earth each one is.
        So, here aresome of the links below. They've even got slight descriptions! WOW!
        Update: I may be already in some kind of DevOps thing...huh...

        page, so here is nothing to amuse you for the moment.</p>
