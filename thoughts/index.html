        <p>I met a few people recently who have sparked my interest in DevOps.
          Due to having no idea what it is, I ended up having around 40 tabs open
          that, although I don't want to lose them, I don't want to have to open
          them all up just to remember what on earth each one is. So, here are
          some of the links below. They've even got slight descriptions! WOW!</p>
